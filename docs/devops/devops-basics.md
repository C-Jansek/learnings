# DevOps

The culture of DevOps shifts the way that Development and Operation teams collaborate. It aims to bring trust, collaboration, problem resolution and continuous improvement for the whole team, both Dev and Ops.

## Dev vs Ops - The traditional way

Traditional companies often have separate Development and [Operations](operations-team.md) teams. The Dev team writes the applications features, and the Ops team creates and maintains the infrastructure that application runs on.

While the boundaries of each teams responsibilities can be clearly defined, the two teams have an inherent conflict: the Dev team wants to produce new features as fast as possible, while the Ops team want stable and reliable infrastructure. Those new features however, are the most likely to throw of this stability and reliability.

This conflict can negatively influence the development process. Since the teams own different [deployment environments](operations-team#Deployment-Environments), differences between these can arise which can lead to difficult to resolve bugs. Information is also siloed, which means that decisions are often made without taking into account, or even asking for the opinion of the other team. Handoffs further slow down the process of development, and increase the duration of the feedback loop.

## Dev + Ops

DevOps teams try to share knowledge and experience across team members. With the combined team, the conflicting goals become one composite goal: delivering stable, reliable software as fast as possible. The combined team improves some factors of the development process massively:

- Faster development and deployment cycles due to shared knowledge and fewer handoffs
- Consistency of deployment environments, from development to production
- Improvement of operations activities by applying dev best-practices

While there are many benefits to DevOps, switching can bring its complications. It can be challenging to agree on processes when team members have different experiences.

## DevOps Culture

Only applying a set of practices and tools is not enough to make DevOps succeed. The DevOps culture is inherent to the success of combining Dev and Ops teams. Collaboration occurs when the members align around the central pillars the DevOps culture:

- **Systems-level thinking** - Think about the whole production system, instead of a single piece or department of that system. This is for both individuals, as the team as a whole. It allows teams to spot and resolve bottlenecks faster.
- **Continuous experimentation and learning** - Accept failure as a learning opportunity. Continuously experiment and learn from what did and didn't work. This encourages rapid development of new features. This includes **blameless retrospectives** (post-mortems) where team members discuss what went well and where they can improve as a team.
- **Feedback loops** - Allow teams to draw insight into their systems by drawing information from each part of that system. Identify and start monitoring metrics which can be used to analyze the performance of the team. This way, processes can be improved and optimized. Bugs are easier and less expensive to fix, when they are identified early.
