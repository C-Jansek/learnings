# IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

Infrastructure as a Service is the most barebones cloud computing service model.

Clients pay for hardware running somewhere in a data center, on which they can install whatever software or application they need. The infrastructure comes in three different parts, which are often supplied in conjunction. These are:

- **Computing power**
  - _General computing_ - E.g. running web servers
  - _Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)_ - E.g. running machine learning models
  - _High Compute Processing (HCP)_ - Specific high load units
- **Storage** - Object, block or file based storage
- **Network** - The glue that holds compute and storage together, and allows for communcation between the two

The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, US) defines IaaS as follows:

> The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).

## Use cases

IaaS is often used to run client software with as much freedom as possible, without having to maintain hardware.

Examples include:

- Virtual Private Servers (VPS)
- Dedicated Server
