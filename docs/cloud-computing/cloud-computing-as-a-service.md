# Cloud computing (as a service)

Cloud computing comes in different forms, including: [SaaS](software-as-a-service.md), [PaaS](platform-as-a-service.md) or [IaaS](infrastructure-as-a-service.md).

Cloud computing is a way of delivering the product to the client. The on-demand availability of computer system resources.

## Characteristics

### Pay-as-you-go

Billing of cloud computing as a service determined for used time and resources. For example: monthly used bandwith, computing hours or used storage space.

### No contracts

On-demand. There are no obligations to using the product for a set amount of time. The client uses the product for as long as needed, and stop using it when not useful anymore.

### Self service

(The basis of) A product should be easy to configure and set up. It should not take weeks or months to configure for it to be useful.
