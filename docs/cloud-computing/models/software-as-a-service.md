# Software as a Service - SaaS

SaaS uses a subscription model to deliver software or applications over the internet.

The software is centrally hosted. Updating and maintaining the software is part of the subscription and thus up to the provider.

## Characteristics

### Customization and configuration

Since the software is centrally hosted, the customers can not fully customize software by altering the hosted code. The customers can often set configuration through a set of predefined options.

### Accelerated feature delivery

More frequent updates to the software are possible (in comparison to traditional software) because:

- **Centrally hosted**: the provider executes updates on software, not customers
- **Single configuration**: the provider has to maintain only one platform/configuration, which speeds up testing and development
- **Single version**: the provider has to support and maintain only the latest version
- **Access to customer data**: the provider has access to all customer data and user behaviour, which makes testing and monitoring easier

### Open integration protocols

Since the software is centrally hosted, the software has no access to internal systems of the customer. To make up for this, SaaS products often feature application programming interfaces (APIs) to make integrations with internal systems possible. This allows for [mashups](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)>).
