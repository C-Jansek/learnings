# SaaS - Software as a Service

SaaS uses a subscription model to deliver software or applications over the internet.

Most SaaS are multi-tenant applications. The software is centrally hosted, and there are multiple clients using the same application. Each client has their own place in the application to securely store their data. Updating and maintaining the software is part of the subscription and thus up to the provider.

SaaS has the highest level of abstaction of the different Cloud Computing Models. It maintains everything from hardware and OS to the application and its data.

## Characteristics

### Customization and configuration

Since the software is centrally hosted, the customers can not fully customize software by altering the hosted code. The customers can often set configuration through a set of predefined options.

### Accelerated feature delivery

More frequent updates to the software are possible (in comparison to traditional software) because:

- **Centrally hosted**: the provider executes updates on software, not customers
- **Single configuration**: the provider has to maintain only one platform/configuration, which speeds up testing and development
- **Single version**: the provider has to support and maintain only the latest version
- **Access to customer data**: the provider has access to all customer data and user behaviour, which makes testing and monitoring easier

### Open integration protocols

Since the software is centrally hosted, the software has no access to internal systems of the customer. To make up for this, SaaS products often feature application programming interfaces (APIs) to make integrations with internal systems possible. This allows for [mashups](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)>).

## Benefits

### Cost

SaaS applications have one all-in monthly subscription. This includes, but is not limited to: hosting, maintenance and support. In comparison to more traditional on-premise (ToDo) solutions, there is no need for a maintenance team with specialized knowledge about this application.

### Scalability

On-demand horizontal or vertical scalability which the service provider will take care of.

### Access anywhere

Secure access to the application from everywhere is part of the core product. No need for installation of software on the users device.

### Newest version

The software is allways running the newest version for anyone. Access to the latest security updates and feature releases for all users.

Integrations with other software are also easier, since the other integrations have to support only one version of the SaaS. This makes for less compatibility issues.

## Use cases

SaaS is common in all kinds of (business) applications.

It covers all kinds of management software, such as: customer relations management, content management, service desk management. SaaS is also often used in communication applications.

Examples include:

- Slack (messaging)
- Microsoft Office 365 (office suite)
- Numbers (payroll management)
- Jira (issue board)
