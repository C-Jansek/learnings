## Deployment

Making a piece of software available to its users.

## Version Control System (Source control) {#vcs}

Tool designed to manage different versions of a file or project.

### Branching {#vcs-branching}

The process of creating a copy of the source code (the “trunk”). Developers can work on their own branches without changing the source code that real users and other developers depend on.

### Merging {#vcs-merging}

The process of combining the changes in one branch with another. This occurs when the differences between the two branches are ready to be reconciled. When conflicts between branches arise during a merge, version control systems can assist in resolving them.

## Infrastructure

Set of resources that support the development, testing, and deployment of applications.
It consists of:

- Hardware (servers, routers, switches)
- Software (operating systems, version control systems, applications)

### Scalability

A system's ability to add (or remove) resources to keep up with growing (or shrinking) demand.

#### Vertical Scaling

Adding computing resources, such as increasing network speeds, storage or RAM.

#### Horizontal Scaling

Adding more servers (nodes) to the network that each run the application. A load balancer distributes work across the nodes.

#### Elasticity

The ability to automatically add or subtract resources to accommodate fluctuating demand.

### Orchestration

The automated configuration, management, and coordination of infrastructure.

## Metrics

Metrics express a value relevant to the system at a specific point fo time.

## Observability

Observability is the degree to which a system's information can be used to locate and fix a problem.
