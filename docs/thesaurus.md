### Deployment

Making a piece of software available to its users.

### Infrastructure

Set of resources that support the development, testing, and deployment of applications.
It consists of:

- Hardware (servers, routers, switches)
- Software (operating systems, version control systems, applications)

### Version Control System (Source control) {#vcs}

Tool designed to manage different versions of a file or project.

#### Branching {#vcs-branching}

The process of creating a copy of the source code (the “trunk”). Developers can work on their own branches without changing the source code that real users and other developers depend on.

#### Merging {#vcs-merging}

The process of combining the changes in one branch with another. This occurs when the differences between the two branches are ready to be reconciled. When conflicts between branches arise during a merge, version control systems can assist in resolving them.
